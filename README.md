# Cloudburst Lawn Sprinkler Systems
A website made from scratch using React, Node.js, and CSS for Cloudburst Lawn Sprinkler Systems, who serve the Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland areas.

### Website is currently in the deployment stage
The website is now live on [*Render*](https://cloudburst-sprinkler.onrender.com/) for testing the production build.\
\
Please note: the web service hosted on Render will need to spin up, and may take longer than expected to load.\
\
This website is finished and in the stage of being deployed. It is currently in the process of switching hosting providers from a shared hosting plan to a dedicated VPS.\
\
It is currently optimized for 320px-2560px, and should view correctly on any mobile or desktop screen sizes. The website is compatible with desktops, laptops, and tablets, as well as both small phones (such as the iPhone SE) and large phones (such as the iPhone 12 Pro Max).
