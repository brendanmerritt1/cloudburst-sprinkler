# Cloudburst Lawn Sprinkler Systems
A website made from scratch using React, Node.js, and CSS for Cloudburst Lawn Sprinkler Systems, who serve the Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland areas.

### WORK IN PROGRESS - Pages may change significantly at any time.
The website is now live on [*Render*](https://cloudburst-sprinkler.onrender.com/) for testing the production build.\
\
Please note: the web service hosted on Render will need to spin up, and may take longer than expected to load.\
\
It is currently optimized for 428px-2560px, and may not view correctly on other smaller mobile screen sizes. The website is compatible with desktops, laptops, tablets, and large phones (such as the iPhone 12 Pro Max). Currently working on optimization for all mobile devices.
